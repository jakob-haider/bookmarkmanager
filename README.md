# README

this is a little demo for a full-fledged bookmarkmanager with various features. 
the sketches for the concept are to be taken from my application portolio.

basically this code is just uploaded to show a little bit of the scale the project should grow to from a backend perspective. 

i'll keep on developing this product in the course of the next weeks!
still to be done: javascript, drag-functions, different views as stated in the paper prototypes.

* for code review: 

a lot of the views is from scaffolding. take a look at the important files from the view:
    in browser route 0.0.0.0:3000/folders/
    
    - marks.html.haml
    - folders/index.html.haml
